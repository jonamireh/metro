# Compiler/IDE graph parity fixtures

These fixtures are compiled by the Metro compiler tests and loaded as source by `MetroGraphValidationParityTest`. The checked-in graph metadata, key reports, and rendered Metro diagnostics define the expected compiler behavior for IDEA graph validation. Reports live under `_reports/<fixture name>` so generated test discovery ignores them.

Graph-metadata fixtures use `NORMALIZE_REPORT_SOURCE_LOCATIONS` because source locations are outside the parity contract and generated IR offsets vary across supported Kotlin compiler versions. Diagnostics are compared as sorted ID/title pairs because source locations and their resulting output order are also outside the contract; duplicate diagnostics remain significant.

Regenerate compiler goldens after an intentional compiler behavior change:

```shell
./gradlew :compiler-tests:test \
  --tests 'dev.zacsweers.metro.compiler.DiagnosticTestGenerated$IdeaParity' \
  -PupdateTestData=true --quiet
```

`BinaryGraph.kt` mirrors the declarations in the IDEA plugin's compiled `libFixture`. Keep the two fixtures aligned when adding binary-resolution coverage. `SuspendGraph.kt` and `SuspendFailure.kt` cover shared suspend propagation and representative valid and invalid request boundaries.
