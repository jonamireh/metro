# Metro IDE Plugin

IDE support for Kotlin projects that use [Metro](https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro).

The plugin is K2-only and depends on the Kotlin plugin. It reads Metro compiler plugin options from
the IDE's Kotlin compiler configuration, then uses the K2 Analysis API and Kotlin stub indexes to
build a project-wide binding index for editor features.

## Features

### Unused Declaration Suppression

Metro-generated code can be the only caller of providers, injected classes, etc. The plugin marks those
declarations as implicitly used so IntelliJ's unused declaration inspection does not report false positives.

Covered declarations include:

- `@Binds`, `@Provides`, and `@Multibinds` members.
- Classes with `@Inject` constructors.
- `@AssistedInject` classes and constructors.
- `@ContributesBinding`, `@ContributesIntoSet`, and `@ContributesIntoMap` classes.
- Graph factory `@Provides` parameters.
- Metro-native Circuit `@CircuitInject` declarations when `enable-circuit-codegen` is enabled.

Configured custom Metro annotations and supported interop annotation sets are read from the same
compiler plugin options used by the compiler.

### Binding Navigation

The plugin adds gutter icons for the standard Metro binding relationships:

- Provider markers on binding origins, such as `@Provides`, `@Binds`, `@Inject`, and contributed
  binding declarations.
- Consumer markers on injected parameters, member-injected properties, and graph accessor members.
- Graph markers on `@DependencyGraph` declarations.

Provider markers navigate to known consumers. Consumer markers navigate to the matching providers,
or show an unresolved marker when the IDE index has no binding for the key.

Optional dependencies are handled two ways:

- An injection site is treated as optional when it carries `@OptionalBinding`/`@OptionalDependency`
  or when it is a parameter with a default value under the default optional-binding behavior. An
  optional site with no binding reads as optional rather than unresolved.
- `@BindsOptionalOf` (Dagger interop) exposes an `Optional<T>` binding, so a site injecting
  `Optional<T>` resolves to it.

Graph markers list the contributions a graph aggregates. A graph extension also reports its parent
graph and inherited contribution count in the tooltip and code vision. An accessor that returns a
`@GraphExtension` (or its factory) is a creation point for the child graph rather than a dependency,
so it gets no consumer marker.

> TODO: Add a screenshot of a consumer marker popup resolving an interface to a concrete binding.

### Code Vision

Metro code vision entries summarize binding relationships above declarations:

- Providers show consumer counts.
- Graphs show contribution counts.

Clicking a code vision entry opens the same navigation popup as the corresponding gutter marker.

### Injected Implementation Inlays

For injection sites declared as an interface or abstract type, the plugin can show the statically
resolved implementation inline.

```kotlin
@Inject
class CheckoutFlow(
  private val api: HttpApi,        // RealHttpApi
  private val interceptors: Set<Interceptor>, // 3 elements
)
```

Single resolved implementations are clickable and navigate to the provider. Multibindings show the
number of contributed elements or map entries. Implicitly assisted parameters, such as
Circuit-provided `Screen`/`Navigator` parameters, can show an `assisted` inlay because they are
supplied at runtime rather than injected from the graph (explicit `@Assisted` parameters already
read as assisted in source, so they get no inlay).

### Metro Tool Window

Open `View > Tool Windows > Metro`, then click **Load** to browse every graph context in the
project. The status indicator shows loading progress or waits for IDE indexing before graphs become
available. Graph extensions with different parent chains appear as separate rows rather than being
merged together.

Calls to `createDynamicGraph` and `createDynamicGraphFactory` appear as separate graph contexts at
their call sites. The browser applies each concrete binding-container type as an override, carries
those bindings into graph extensions, and keeps multibinding contributions additive. Equivalent
calls in one file share a context, matching the compiler, while calls from different files remain
distinct.

Expanding a graph groups its bindings into scoped, unscoped, multibinding, and contributed
categories. The search field filters by binding key or implementation name, and double-clicking a
binding navigates to its declaration. After validation, an Unused category lists authored
`@Provides` and `@Binds` bindings that were not reached by that graph or its validated extensions.

Select a graph and use **More > Export Graph Debug Info** to write a local report to the IDE log
directory. Reports omit source bodies, absolute paths, and annotation literal values, but still
contain project and type identifiers. Review the file before sharing it.

### On-Demand Graph Validation

Graphs can be validated from their gutter icon, the editor context menu, or the Validate action in
the Metro tool window. Validation runs in the background and seals every concrete extension context
before its parent graph.

The IDE adapter uses Metro's shared binding-graph implementation to report:

- Missing bindings with navigable request traces.
- Dependency cycles.
- Duplicate bindings and duplicate map keys.
- Empty multibindings that do not allow emptiness.
- Bindings used from incompatible graph scopes.
- Suspend-provider errors, including non-suspend accessors, synchronous `Provider`/`Lazy`
  boundaries, unsupported suspend multibindings, member injection, assisted factories, and a
  missing optional `runtime-coroutines` artifact.

Suspend validation uses the same validator as the compiler, including transitive propagation, accessor boundaries, multibindings, wrapper restrictions, member injection, assisted factories, and runtime requirements. It recognizes `suspend () -> T`, `SuspendProvider<T>`, and `SuspendLazy<T>` boundaries, and preserves exact wrapper pass-through from factory-included graph dependencies. Differential tests compare successful and failing suspend graphs with compiler reports.

The last result remains visible in the tool window and on the graph's gutter badge. Results are
marked stale after relevant code changes until validation runs again. Unexpected plugin failures
are reported as internal plugin errors rather than Metro graph diagnostics.

## Settings

Project settings live under `Settings > Tools > Metro`.

- Suppress unused-declaration warnings for Metro-injected declarations
- Suppress false-positive kapt configuration warnings in Metro-enabled modules
- Show binding navigation (gutter icons, code vision, inlay hints)
- Resolve bindings from compiled dependencies
- Show "assisted" inlay hints for Circuit implicit assisted types

Turning off binding navigation hides editor decorations only. The Metro tool window and explicit
graph validation remain available, and library resolution can still be configured independently.

Gutter marker categories are also toggleable under IntelliJ's gutter icon settings.

### Library Resolution

Project _source_ is indexed from Metro-relevant annotations. _Compiled_ dependencies are covered where
the compiler exposes enough metadata:

- Constructor-injected classes resolve on demand from library metadata.
- Contributions are discovered from generated Metro hint functions (matching how metroc discovers them).
- Contribution-provider container objects are attributed through `@Origin`.
- `internal` contribution hints respect the compiler's formal friend/associated compilation
  visibility and are filtered from non-friend external libraries.

> TODO: Add a screenshot from a sample project showing navigation into a library contribution.

## Current Limits

Resolution starts from a project-wide, key-based index and then applies per-graph membership on
top: each graph's context aggregates its scopes (following `@GraphExtension` parent chains), wired
binding containers (including transitive `includes`), factory `@Includes` dependencies,
contribution merging (`excludes` on graphs, `replaces` on contributions), and scope matching for
scoped bindings (a graph's declared scopes include the `@SingleIn(X::class)` implicitly conveyed
by `@DependencyGraph(X::class)`). Popups and inlays use the per-graph view when graphs exist and
fall back to the global view otherwise.

Not yet modeled:

- A pinnable graph context for editor navigation and inlays. Inlays currently appear only when all
  applicable graph contexts agree; gutter popups summarize context-dependent candidates.
- Exact parity with every compiler validation and diagnostic.
- Validation-backed editor inspections and quick fixes.
- Graph diagram views.

## Known Issues

- Navigating into Compose files can surface a `ProhibitedAnalysisException: Analysis is not
  allowed: Called in the EDT thread` error banner from the bundled Compose IDE plugin's
  `ComposeFoldingBuilder` ([KMT-2432](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KMT-2432)). This is not
  caused by this plugin — any editor open triggers it. Fixed in IntelliJ IDEA 2026.1.3; Android
  Studio has not picked up the fix yet.

## Development

The IDE plugin is a standalone Gradle build. Run these commands from the repository root.

Run a sandboxed IDE with the plugin installed:

```shell
./gradlew -p idea-plugin runLocalIde
```

To use a locally installed IDE:

```shell
./gradlew -p idea-plugin runLocalIde "-PintellijPlatformTesting.idePath=/Applications/Android Studio.app"
```

Compile the plugin:

```shell
./gradlew -p idea-plugin compileKotlin --quiet
```

Run plugin tests:

```shell
./gradlew -p idea-plugin test --quiet
```

## Icons

Conventions: filled dots are bindings, strokes are edges, green provides, blue consumes,
navy is structure, dashed means not held. Each icon has a `_dark` variant.
