/**
 * Finds every binding that must be initialized from a suspend context.
 *
 * A binding requires suspend initialization when it is itself suspend or has a non-deferred
 * dependency that requires suspend initialization. Propagation runs opposite to dependency lookup:
 * ```
 * Dependency lookup:    A --> B --> C (suspend)
 * Suspend propagation:  A <-- B <-- C
 *
 * Deferred dependency:  A --> suspend () -> C
 *                             propagation stops
 * ```
 *
 * The worklist is incremental because a child graph may inspect an unsealed parent:
 * ```
 * query A --> resolve A and B --> C is missing
 * graph changes --> retry C --> C is suspend --> mark C, B, then A
 * ```
 *
 * Each binding's dependencies are expanded once. A missing binding is retried only after the graph
 * generation changes, and each key enters the propagation queue only the first time it is marked
 * suspend. These properties also make cycles terminate without a separate fixpoint pass.
